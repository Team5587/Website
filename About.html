          FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded in 1989
           to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. Based
            in Manchester, NH, the 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity designs accessible, innovative
             programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science,
            technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.
             There are three different competitions based on age group. ​

          The First Lego League is a robotic competition offered by FIRST Robotics in which children,
          ages 9-14, design, build, and program a robot to solve a real-world problem. Teams are comprised
          of 2 or more adult coaches and up to 10 team members. The robots are built using LEGO MINDSTORMS®
          and the competition takes place on a table-top playing field. First Lego League is offered in 80 different countries
         worldwide and promotes STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and math), problem solving, and team-building.

          First Tech Challenge is a robotic competition offered by First Robotics for young adults, ages 12-18.
          Following a sports model, groups of 10+ students design, build, and program a robot to complete a task.
          The team receives the competition subject in September and competition starts in October and lasts until March.

      <p class= "col-sm-9">
          First Robotics Challenge is an international robotics challenge offered by First Robotics for High school Students.
           Teams, made of around 25 of students and mentors, design, build and program a robot, either from scratch
           or from a kit that can be bought from FRC. The teams have “kickoff day” where they receive the goals of the
            competition and then have six weeks to build the robot for the competition.

        <p>
          This is the competition that we, Titan Robotics, competes in. As you can see, on the left is this years competition
           that is steam themed. Our robot is attempting to confront many of the challenges including placing gears, shooting
            high goals, and climbing the robe at the end of the match.
