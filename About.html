          FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded in 1989
           to inspire youth interest and participation in science and technology. Based
            in Manchester, NH, the 501(c)(3) non-profit designs accessible, innovative
             programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science,
            technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.
             FIRST hosts three different competitions based on age group. ​

          The First Lego League is a robotic competition offered by FIRST Robotics in which children
          ages 9-14 design, build, and program a robot to solve a real-world problem. Teams are comprised
          of 2 or more adult coaches and up to 10 team members. The robots are built using LEGO MINDSTORMS®
          and the competition takes place on a table-top playing field. First Lego League is offered in 80 different countries
         worldwide and promotes STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and math), problem solving, and team-building.

      <p class= "col-sm-8">
          First Robotics Competition is an international robotics challenge offered by First Robotics for High school Students. Teams, made of around 30  students and mentors, design, build and program a robot from scratch and/or from a kit that FRC sells. The teams have “kickoff day,” where they learn the goals of the upcoming competition and then have six weeks to build the robot for the competition.<br><br>
          Titan Robotics competes in FRC. The video on the left shows this year's competition, which is Steam Punk themed. Our robot will attempt to conquer many of the challenges of this year's competition, including placing gears, shooting high goals, and climbing a rope at the end of each match.
