				First Robotics Competition is an international robotics challenge offered by First Robotics for High school Students. Teams, made of around 30 of students and mentors, design, build and program a robot, either from scratch or from a kit that can be bought
				from FRC. The teams have “kickoff day,” where they receive the goals of the competition and then have six weeks to build the robot for the competition.<br><br> This is the competition that we, Titan Robotics, compete in. The video on the left
				shows this year's competition, which is Steam Punk themed. Our robot is attempting to confront and conquer many of the challenges of this year's competition, including placing gears, shooting high goals, and climbing a rope at the end of each match.
