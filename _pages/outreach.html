      <p>Titan Robotics has taken part in many different activities in order to increase awareness of the various FIRST programs
        and promote STEM in the local community. Our team strongly believes that giving back to the community is an integral
        part of the FIRST experience, and we do this through the various events that we take part in or help to create. From
        teaching youth about STEM opportunities to creating educational and hands-on learning experiences, our team is committed
        to supporting our community.</p>
