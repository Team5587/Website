      <p>Titan Robotics has taken part in many different activities in order to increase awareness of the various FIRST programs and promote STEM in the local community. Our team strongly believes that giving back to the community is an integral part of
        the FIRST experience, and we do this through the various events that we take part in or help to create. From teaching youth about STEM opportunities to creating educational and hands-on learning experiences, our team is committed to supporting
        our community.</p>
