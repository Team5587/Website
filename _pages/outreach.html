            <p class="content">Over the summer, Titan Robotics ran a camp for elementary school students to learn about
              rocketry and the engineering design process. Students brainstormed, designed, built, and launched their
              rockets and had a great time with their Titan Robotics counselors!

            <p class="content">This past October, Titan Robotics met with the Afghan Dreamers to discuss how girls can
              make an impact in STEM globally. The Titans demonstrated their robot and gave the Dreamers a tour of the
              shop. They also discussed the importance of a STEM education, especially for women, throughout the world.

            <p class="content">For the third year in a row, Titan Robotics worked with students of all ages on the NVCC
              campus to help them learn engineering skills by building stomp rockets. Students learned about rocketry
              and the engineering design process during the activity. The team members were also able to demonstrate
              and teach students about their robot!</p>

            <p class="content">With the help of two other FIRST teams, Titan Robotics explained the benefits of
              robotics to students and parents attending the event. We demoed Kernbread and Kernflake, discussed our
              favorite things about robotics, and encouraged the participants that they have a place in STEM and
              robotics.</p>

              Titan Robotics team members offered so many STEM learning opportunities to the Alexandria community
              at this event! They enjoyed demonstrating the robot for the kids and letting them each take a turn at
              driving it themselves. Team members also helped students design their own balloon powered cars and
              colorful catapults. Little
              ones even had the
              opportunity to color robot pictures! It was a fun event for all!
