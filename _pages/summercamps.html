            Titan Robotics offers a variety of STEM-themed summer programs for students from kindergarten through ninth
            grade. All of our content is developed and taught entirely by team members, and our camps are held at <a
                href="https://www.acps.k12.va.us/tcw/" target="_blank">T.C. Williams High School</a>.

                computer programming in the popular Java language to intermediate level design in one week. Campers will learn
                through engaging projects and guidance, ending the week with a project of their own invention and skills to kick off
                a journey into the world of computer science. No prior experience is needed, but this intensive will go into greater
                depth and cover more advanced concepts than the half day camp last year. This camp is excellent for both new and
                returning campers!
