            Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools in Virginia have been closed for the rest of the academic
            year. Because of our concern for the health and safety of our community in addition to the loss of our venue,
            we have canceled our May STEM expo and our in-person <a href="/virtualcamp">summer camps</a> in July and August. </b></u>

            We are deeply saddened by the loss of our competition season as well as our equally valuable and enjoyable
            outreach opportunities. In spite of this, we will continue to serve our community by hosting a series of
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYOGjxGOFGPVwwazCmtl_3I_Xeq33v8_" target="_blank">virtual outreach
                activities</a> designed to continue sharing STEM with our community and offering an online alternative to our <a href="/virtualcamp">summer camps</a>.

            Even as we practice social distancing during these difficult times, we all are united in support of our
            community.

        </p>

            Stay safe and healthy; we hope to see you soon once we get through this.
