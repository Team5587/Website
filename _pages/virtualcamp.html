            Since we had to cancel our in-person summer camps due to the spread of COVID-19, we decided to bring our content to you.
            While we know this won't be the same as our traditional camps, check out the resources below for a small preview of
            what we would have done this summer, including experiments, crafts, and lessons based on our 2020 camp themes!

            <p class="lead">The Intro to Engineering camp is an interactive camp that will introduce young students to the basics of
                engineering such as simple machines, the physics behind various structures, and more. Each day, we will have 2-3
                activities that you can do at home with your camper along with explanations of the science behind these activities.
                We will be sending out videos every day with the correlating lessons and will also have office hours at 2 pm each
                day for any questions.</p>

                Over the course of the camp, they will design, code, and test their own virtual robots in the style of Lego
                Mindstorm Robots, including sensor use. This camp is recommended for grades 3-5, although it is open to students of
                all ages and no knowledge of Scratch is required! No live component is included, so this is a great activity for
                those desiring a flexible schedule.

            Due to the unusual circumstances, we have decided to make all of our summer programs entirely free and available to
            anyone who is interested. Our primary goal is, as always, to provide accessible STEM opportunities to our community, and this
            seemed like the best way to accomplish our goal. However, if you would like to help us create even more opportunities in the
            future through a donation to our team, please <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/2714254" target="_blank">support us with PayPal</a>. 
            Thank you for your contribution!
